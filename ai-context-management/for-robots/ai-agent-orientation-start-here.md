# AI Agent Orientation - Start Here

Welcome! You are being onboarded to a new project that uses an AI context system. This system is designed to solve the common problem of context loss between AI chat sessions.

## Directory Structure Overview

This project uses a structured approach to maintain context across conversations. Here's what everything means:

### `project-setup/` - Foundational Documents (Set Once)

**`agent-operating-rules.md`** - Your core operating principles for this project. This defines how you should communicate, what standards to follow, workflow preferences, and red lines you must never cross. These rules should be kept in mind throughout all interactions.

**`project-vision-and-goals.md`** - The big picture of what we're building and why. This explains the project's purpose, target users, success criteria, and long-term direction.

**`project-architecture.md`** - The technical architecture, technology stack, system design, and key architectural patterns. This provides the technical foundation for understanding how the system is built.

**`code-patterns-and-conventions.md`** - Established code patterns, naming conventions, and coding standards specific to this project. Follow these patterns when writing code.

### `current-work/` - Active Context (Updated Frequently)

**`current-work-focus.md`** - A 3-5 sentence summary with three levels of focus. The **Project Goal** describes the high-level vision of what we're building (the big picture). The **Intermediate Goal** specifies the current phase or milestone we're working toward (medium-term). The **Current Task** states exactly what is being worked on right now (immediate focus). This hierarchical structure helps you quickly understand where we are in the overall journey.

**`current-context-for-new-chat.md`** - A living document with the current state of the project. What's working, what's broken, active issues, recent changes. This should be updated regularly as work progresses.

### `past-chat-record/` - Historical Archive

This directory contains archived summaries from previous AI chat sessions. Each file should be dated and include key decisions, code written, and problems solved. This serves as the project's memory.

## Your Instructions

**First, quick question:** Is this a new project you're just starting, or an existing project where you're adding the AI context system?

### If This is an EXISTING Project

Great! Let me get oriented first. Please let me read:
1. `current-work/current-work-focus.md` - To understand where you are right now
2. `current-work/current-context-for-new-chat.md` - To see the current state

After that, I'll help you fill in any missing `project-setup/` files if needed.

### If This is a NEW Project

Perfect! Let's set up the AI context system. I'll ask you questions to fill out the background files that will help me (and future AI agents) understand your project.

**We'll cover:**
- Project vision and goals
- Technical architecture and tech stack
- Code patterns and conventions you want to follow
- Operating rules for how we should work together
- Current work focus

**Ready? Let's set up your project context, one step at a time.**

### Step 1: Project Vision
What is this project about? Tell me:
- What are you building?
- Why are you building it?
- Who is it for?

_(Keep it brief - I'll capture this in `project-vision-and-goals.md`)_

### Step 2: Technical Architecture
What's the technical foundation?
- What languages, frameworks, or technologies?
- Any key architectural decisions already made?

_(I'll document this in `project-architecture.md`)_

### Step 3: Code Patterns
Are there any specific code patterns, naming conventions, or standards you want to follow?

_(Goes into `code-patterns-and-conventions.md`)_

### Step 4: Operating Rules
How should we work together?
- Any preferences on communication style?
- Testing or documentation requirements?
- Things I should never do without asking?

_(These become your `agent-operating-rules.md`)_

### Step 5: Current Work
What are you working on right now?
- Overall project goal?
- Current phase/milestone?
- Immediate task?

_(This sets up `current-work-focus.md`)_

---

**After setup:** I'll briefly explain how to use `current-context-for-new-chat.md` and `past-chat-record/` to maintain context across sessions.
