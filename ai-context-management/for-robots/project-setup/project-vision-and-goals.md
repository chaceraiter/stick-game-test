# Project Vision and Goals

## What We're Building

A browser-based 2D stick figure arena shooter/platformer. Think "Worms meets stick figure combat" - side-view fixed arenas where the player shoots enemy stick figures to complete levels.

## Why

Fun personal project for learning game development. This is a test/learning project, so the priority is getting things working and understanding how they work, not production polish.

## Who It's For

The developer (learning project). May share with friends for testing/fun.

## Core Game Concept

- **View:** Side-view platformer, fixed arena (not scrolling)
- **Player:** Stick figure that can run, jump, and shoot
- **Enemies:** Static stick figures placed around the map (don't move or shoot back initially)
- **Win Condition:** Hit all enemy stick figures to complete the level
- **Progression:** Random level generation with new enemy placements after each win
- **Hazards:** Water at the bottom of the map that kills the player

## MVP Features (Priority Order)

1. Player movement (run, jump)
2. Basic arena/level with platforms
3. Laser gun shooting
4. Enemy stick figures (static targets)
5. Level completion detection
6. Water hazard
7. Random level generation

## Aspirational Features (Later)

- Grappling gun
- More weapon types
- Destructible terrain
- Smarter enemies (movement, shooting back)
- Multiple lives or health system

## Success Criteria

A playable game loop: spawn in level → shoot all enemies → new level generates → repeat. Fun to play, code is understandable.
