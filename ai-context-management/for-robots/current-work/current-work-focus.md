# Current Work Focus

Weapon system baseline is in place; shifting focus to improving player movement feel and adding movement abilities.

- **Project Goal:** Build a browser-based stick figure arena shooter with depth in combat, enemies, and procedural levels

- **Intermediate Goal:** Improve player movement (feel + abilities)

- **Current Task:** Movement pass 1: lower jump height + step-up small ledges
