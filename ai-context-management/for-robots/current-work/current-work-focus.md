# Current Work Focus

Playable prototype at larger scale (700x900) with full notebook paper aesthetic. Platform shape library complete with 15 shapes and 5 mixed layouts. Walls and water hazard in place. Ready to refine visual details.

- **Project Goal:** Build a browser-based stick figure arena shooter with random level generation (Worms-style vibes, notebook paper aesthetic)

- **Intermediate Goal:** Refine visual scale and proportions to match the hand-drawn reference style

- **Current Task:** Wishlist defined - next steps are: reduce character size, simplify water, adjust wall heights, tweak platform layouts
