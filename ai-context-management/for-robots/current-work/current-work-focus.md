# Current Work Focus

We have a working playable prototype! The core game loop is functional: player can move, jump between platforms, shoot enemies, complete levels, and progress to randomly-generated next levels. Water hazard adds platforming challenge.

- **Project Goal:** Build a browser-based stick figure arena shooter with random level generation (Worms-style vibes)

- **Intermediate Goal:** Polish the prototype and add more game feel - better visuals, more variety, additional features from the aspirational list

- **Current Task:** Checkpoint reached! Next up could be: stick figure sprites, random platform generation, lives/game over system, or sound effects
